[Required] Course Repository, Software Installation, Tips and Tricks
Important! This is required reading to be successful in the course.



Course repositories

The official course repository: https://github.com/15Dkatz/cryptochain

Use this as a resource if you’re ever stuck with syntax errors or weird bugs in your code :)

"commit-by-lecture by breakdown" repository: https://github.com/15Dkatz/cryptochain_commits

It has an index list of a commit per lecture in this course. You may find this one more helpful as you navigate the project, and get stuck at particular sections.

It’s also worth mentioning right now, that if you’ve done the original blockchain course, pay particular attention to the tips and tricks at the end of this article.



Next, make sure to have the following software installed!

Software Installations:



1. A Code Editor and Command Line Application

For a code editor, I recommend Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/. I also recommend configuring it to open via the command line:

CMD-SHIFT-P

Enter “Shell Command”, and choose “Install ‘code’ command in path.

Then you can run $ code /folder to open folders in VSCode from your shell.

For the command line application, on MacOS or Linux, I recommend the native Terminal application (or Iterm2).



WINDOWS USERS: I absolutely recommend downloading Git Bash. This course was recorded using a bash environment. Using Git Bash will make doing this course a smooth process.



2. Node.js.

If you don’t already have Node.js installed, here is the download page: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Once you have Node.js installed, run the following commands on the command line

$ node -v

See a value like `v16.15.1` or higher

$ npm -v

See a value like `v8.11.0` or higher



3. Postman. This app allows developers to send custom HTTP Requests. Here is the link to install Postman: https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates



4. (Optional) Redis. There will come a point where you may opt to use Redis for the networking part of the course. There will be instructions again later in the course. But, while you're setting up, you may want to try installing Redis now!

That being said, installing Redis is OPTIONAL. There's a Redis alternative if you don't want to spend a lot of time setting up locally (especially since it's particularly tricky on Windows).

Once, you have Redis, the key command to run is:

$ redis-server

If you can run the above, you’re all good! Feel free to get a head start on downloading Redis

Tips and Tricks



Did you do the original “build a blockchain and cryptocurrency” course? Then you may be interested in jump all the way to the frontend/deployment sections of the course. Watch the blockchain backend review, and continue from there.



Note however, the backend has been refactored with a test-driven development style for this course. Through the test-driven development approach, you’ll get to write the code yourself - as long as your methods get the tests to pass! You’ll learn a lot by re-doing the backend, and testing your ability to write the code yourself.



The course is in your hands :)
